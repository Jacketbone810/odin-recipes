    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="description">
        <p>You can never go wrong with a chocolate chip cookie. Basically, it is the default delicious snack to bake. I remember that the reason 
            I started to bake was because it was the only way to get my mom to buy me an infinite amount of sweets. If I just made them, she 
            would finance it, since I was developing a skill. Now, I do it because I love the process and the look on my loved one's faces when
            they take a bite of something they've asked for. Sometimes, its a simple chocolate chip cookie.
